/*
We will learn about:

1) Basic Data Structures
2) Big O Notation
3) Searching Algorithms
4) Sorting Algorithms
5) Graphs
6) Trees

DS: A named location that can be used to store and organize data.
example: Family(A heirarchy of family relationships.)
example: array(A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.)

Algorithm: A collection of steps to solve a problem.
example: (Baking a pizza)(it will be done step by step)
example: Linear Search.

Why DSA?
1) Write code that is both time and memory effecient.
2) For job interviews.
3) To get familiar with trees and graphs to get going in the field.
